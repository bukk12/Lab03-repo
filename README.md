# Lab03-repo

## making a change to commit!

### Using Git for the first time

Today we used Git to upload code from our local PC text editor to Github using the Terminal!

It was complicated but once you have it down is fairly easy.
1. first we created a new Repo to use
2. next open your terminal and got to home directory (cd ~)
3. if you dont have one already create a projects folder using (mkdir projects)
4. get into your new projects folder (cd projects)
5. clone your repo into projects using git (git clone https://projecturlhere.com)
6. open the new repo folder (cd REPONAME)
7. use (Git status) to check status of your files
8. now that we are ready to make changes to our repo remember ACP! Add, Change, Push
9. use (git add README.md) to make changes to that file
10. use (code .) to open your file in vs code and start making changes
11. after you have made your changes to the file you are editing, in the terminal use (git commit -m 'your message here') to commit your changes with a message
12. lastly use (git push) to send your changes to GitHub and everyone can see your progess!
